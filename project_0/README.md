### Projacts descriptions
Guess the number guessed by computer in the minimum number of attempts

:arrow up:[to contants]()


### What case we are solving
We must to make the programm, that guess the number in the minimun number of attempts

**Conditions:**
- The computer guessed the an integer from 0 to 100, and we have to guess it. By "guess" is meant to "write" a program that guessing a number
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether a random number is greater ot less than the one we need.

**Quality metric**
The results are evalueted by the average number of attempts with 1000 repetitions

**What we practice**
Learning to write good Python code
