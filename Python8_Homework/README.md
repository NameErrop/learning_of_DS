### Project descriptions
Guess the number hidden by computer in the minimum number of attempts



### What case we are solving
We must to make the programm, that guess the number in the minimun number of attempts.

**Conditions:**
- The computer hidden an integer from 0 to 100, and we have to guess it. By "guess" is meant to "write" a program that guessing a number.
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether a random number is greater ot less than the one we need.
- We must "guess" the number in no more than 20 attempts.

**Quality metric**
The results are evalueted by the average number of attempts with 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**
Learning to write good Python code.
Learning to work with IDE.
Learning to work with GitHub.


### Brief information about the date
We must to make the algorithm, that guess the number in no more than 20 attemtps.


### Stage of work 
1. Creating a function that guesses a number.
2. Check function at 1000 attempts to guess number.
3. Checking compliance with the program conditions of the task.


### Results
We make the algorithm that guess the hidden number in average of 5 attempts.


### Conclusions
Strengthened skills in working with Python. 
Strengthened skills in working with IDE and GitHub.
